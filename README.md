Intrusion Detection: A trap wire fence detects breaches when elephants break the wire.
Instant Alerts: Sends real-time notifications to farmers and wildlife officers via a Flutter app.
Automated Alarm: Triggers a frequency-based deterrent alarm upon detection.
Cloud-Backed Monitoring: Uses Firebase for data storage and alert management.
🛠️ Technologies Used

Hardware: Microcontroller, voltage sensor, trap wire system
Software: Flutter (mobile app), Firebase (cloud storage & notifications)
Communication: IoT protocols for real-time data transmission
